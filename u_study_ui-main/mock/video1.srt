00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Welcome back aliens my name is Devon Reddy and in this video we're going to talk
about

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,600
core Java.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,920
In this particular course which is a lengthy video you're going to learn
everything from

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,800
the basics of core Java to the end of core Java.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,960
Now this is not the first time I'm uploading the video on Java.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,820
If you can see from last few years you will find multiple Java playlist and
multiple

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,260
Java full-fledged video.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,040
But we all know right the quality of videos are going up every day plus the
number of features

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,620
getting added to a language is going up and that's the reason I'm going to re-
record

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,420
the entire course.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,340
Now this is a full-fledged course and that's why it's so lengthy but you cannot
finish

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,260
the entire course in one day even if it says to 12 hours or 13 hours it will
take time.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,700
Now let's talk about Java.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,620
Now why Java is so famous?

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,300
Now if you see the programming index the top 5 programming language you will
always find

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,940
Java there maybe at the first position or at the fourth position you will find
Java.

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,380
Why Java is so famous is because Java has multiple features which helps it to be
used in

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,740
the enterprise market.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,820
I mean not just enterprise market it can be used for mobile development web
development

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,320
and of course enterprise application.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,460
And most of the big companies if you go there they are using Java as their
preferred language.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Now in Java we have a technology called JVM and it's not just Java we have
multiple languages

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
running on JVM.

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,100
So even if you are working on some other language let's say Kotlin, Scala,
Groovy,

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,540
ultimately you are working on Java technology and that's why if you learn core
Java it is

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,060
much easier for you to jump to different languages.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,100
And I have also observed irrespective of which interior you are going for.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,180
It can be for development or testing and that doesn't matter which language you
are working

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,180
on there.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,340
Maybe Python, C sharp, C++.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,740
They might ask you Java questions because most of the interior questions are
based on Java

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,500
because they feel that if you know Java that means you know other languages as
well or

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,580
you can learn other languages easily.

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,220
As for my experience or did I forgot to introduce myself?

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,020
My name is Evan Reddy I am a corporate trainer, software developer and currently
focusing

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,300
more on blockchain but Java is my first love.

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,500
So I am working on Java from last 12 years.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,820
I've made multiple courses on Java on YouTube and different platforms and yeah I
can

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,260
teach Java any day, any time.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,580
Yeah, sometimes I have to watch my own videos today wise the concept but the
thing is I

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,820
love Java and with this experience I am making the entire course.

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,340
I was talking about my experience right.

43
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,780
In fact I have learned multiple languages in this all 12 years.

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,260
Maybe I have worked on 12 different languages.

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,420
You can name it maybe C++, C Python, Java, JavaScript, Go language.

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,060
So I love most of the languages.

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Some languages I learned just for the projects.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,100
But then when I was learning those languages I was feeling hate it's so easy.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,460
It's because I have learned Java.

50
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,780
Yes people say Java is difficult.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,660
Yes to start with it is difficult.

52
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,700
Maybe if you want to learn Java is your first language.

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,940
It kind of difficult because if you are coming from other languages let's say
Python or

54
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,620
JavaScript and if you want to print one statement you can actually see that in
one line.

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,620
That's not the case with Java.

56
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,380
You have to write five lines of code.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,100
Once you make a big application the number of lines will remain almost same.

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
So Java is difficult.

59
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,580
Yes it is to start with but the thing is Java is one of the most readable
language.

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,820
What I mean by that is if you are looking at someone else code you can read the
Java code

61
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,300
line by line.

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,340
That's not true with other languages.

63
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
So Java is great in that terms.

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,020
Java is maintainable and maybe that's why they most of the industries are
preferring

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,540
to use Java.

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,020
Now Java has multiple features.

67
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,820
We'll talk about those features later but just to name them we got what I which
is right

68
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,420
once run anywhere.

69
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,420
It supports multiple multithreads.

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,060
It has a collection API concept.

71
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,660
You can handle the exceptions and we are going to learn everything in this
particular course.

72
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,340
Now just to go for the history of Java Java was made in 1995 by Son Maccosystem
and it

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,060
was led by the team of James Gosling later on Oracle bought sons and now the
trademark

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,500
of Java belongs to Oracle.

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,860
Just in between Oracle did some messed up things with Java but yeah they are
back on track

76
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,900
and the beauty is Java is getting updated in every six months.

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,540
Not the major updates but they are working hard to make Java as the most
powerful language.

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
So I hope you were excited for the entire course.

79
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,620
We are going to start from the basic as I mentioned and you will learn a lot of
different

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
stuff.

81
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,500
But as I mentioned it's not about completing the entire course in one day.

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,420
You can use a timeline to jump between these sections and also with this we also
have

83
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
a code there.

84
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,740
So in the description you will find the link, GitHub link where you can access
all the codes

85
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,820
and maybe it will be helpful for you to write this code.

86
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
So let's start the journey.
