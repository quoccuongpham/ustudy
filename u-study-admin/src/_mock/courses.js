      'Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed with the goal of being platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.\n\nOne of the key features of Java is its "write once, run anywhere" principle, which allows developers to write code once and then run it on any platform without modification. This is made possible by the JVM, which interprets Java bytecode and translates it into machine code that can be executed by the underlying hardware.',

    description:
      'The Problem\n\nData scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.     \n\nHowever, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.    \n\nAnd how can you do that?  \n\nUniversities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)   \n\nMost online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture  \n\nThe Solution   \n\nData science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.   \n\nUnderstanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out  \n\nMathematics  \n\nStatistics   \n\nPython   \n\nApplying advanced statistical techniques in Python   \n\nData Visualization  \n\nMachine Learning  \n\nDeep Learning  \n\nEach of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.   \n\nSo, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2024.   \n\nWe believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field – having all the necessary resources in one place.  \n\nMoreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).   \n\nThe Skills\n\n   1. Intro to Data and Data Science\n\nBig data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?     \n\nWhy learn it? As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.  \n\n   2. Mathematics \n\nLearning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.   \n\nWe take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.   \n\nWhy learn it?  \n\nCalculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.\n\n   3. Statistics \n\nYou need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.  \n\nWhy learn it?  \n\nThis course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.\n\n   4. Python\n\nPython is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.\n\nWhy learn it?   \n\nWhen it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.  \n\n   5. Tableau\n\nData scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.\n\nWhy learn it?   \n\nA data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.  \n\n   6. Advanced Statistics \n\nRegressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.  \n\nWhy learn it?  \n\nData science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section.  \n\n   7. Machine Learning \n\nThe final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data scientist from a data analyst. This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.  \n\nWhy learn it?   \n\nMachine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for you to control the machines.  \n\n**What you get**\n\nA $1250 data science training program   \n\nActive Q&A support  \n\nAll the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist  \n\nA community of data science learners  \n\nA certificate of completion   \n\nAccess to future updates  \n\nSolve real-life business cases that will get you the job   \n\nYou will become a data scientist from scratch   We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee. No risk for you. The content of the course is excellent, and this is a no-brainer for us, as we are certain you will love it.',
